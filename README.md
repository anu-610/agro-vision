# Agro Vision üå± - AI-Powered Plant Disease Diagnosis

**Empowering New Farmers & Home Gardeners with Multimodal AI**

Agro Vision is a smart agricultural assistant designed to make plant disease diagnosis easy and accessible for everyone, especially **new farmers learning the ropes** and **home gardeners** cultivating vegetables for their daily needs. Using a combination of AI technologies, Agro Vision helps you quickly identify potential problems with your plants and get actionable advice.

This project was developed for the **IIT Mandi iHub & HCI Foundation Multimodal AI Hackathon**.

## üí° How It Works: A Multimodal Approach

Agro Vision understands your plant's health through multiple inputs:

1.  **üì∏ Image Input:** Upload a photo of a plant leaf. Our custom-trained model based on `EfficientNetV2-S` analyzes the image to identify diseases affecting **Potato, Pepper, and Tomato** plants.
2.  **‚úçÔ∏è Text Input:** Describe the symptoms you see or ask a specific question about your plant's health.
3.  **üé§ Voice Input:** Simply click the microphone icon and speak your observations or questions. The browser's built-in speech recognition transcribes your voice into text.
4.  **üìç Location Input (Context):** Optionally share your location. Agro Vision fetches real-time **weather data** (temperature & humidity) for your area. This context helps our AI provide smarter, more relevant diagnoses and solutions (e.g., confirming fungal risk in humid weather).

The backend uses this combined information to query the **Google Gemini API**, generating a context-aware diagnosis and actionable treatment advice.
